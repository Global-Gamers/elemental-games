<p style= "color: green">The Peashooter is a playable plant in Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare whose main weapon is the Pea Cannon. Peashooter serves as a front line assault, or a hit and run attacker, making them quite useful in many situations. Peashooters are easy to use, so they are recommended for beginner players. Peashooter is armed with a Chili Bean Bomb, which allow player to vanquish multiple zombies within the blast range. Peashooter can also perform a Hyper ability which increase its speed and its jump height. Peashooter also can root itself down, and transform into a Gatling Pea which can fire up to 100 peas, which deal a lot of damage. Even without these, Peashooter and its variants can be incredibly broken when put in the right hands.</p>

<h1 style="color: green; font-size 40px">Chomper</h1>

<p style= "color: green">Chomper is a plant in Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare. Much like in the original game, it can eat zombies and instantly kill them, but this also means the Chomper is a close combat fighter and quite powerful up close and can be overwhelming, but has no ranged attack except goop which is meant to slow enemies. Unlike in the first game, it can burrow underground to catch zombies by surprise, as well as spit goop to slow enemies and place Spikeweeds to snare enemies.</p>

<h1 style="color: green; font-size 40px">Sunflower</h1>

<p style="color: green">The Sunflower is a re-occurring plant throughout the Plants vs. Zombies series. Unlike in its predecessors, the Sunflower in Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare is not present for the collection of sun, as it only exists in Boss Mode, but is instead a class designed for healing other plants. This makes it more important of a class than some others, as it should be noted there are few other ways to heal.</p>

<h1 style="color: green; font-size 40px">Cactus</h1>
<img src="http://123kinect.com/wp-content/gallery/plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare/pvz-character-art_01.jpg" width="100" height="120">
<p style= "color: green">The Cactus is a re-occurring plant in the Plants vs. Zombies series. It serves a playable purpose in Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare as a playable character on the Plants faction. Cactus serve as the sniper or a marksman of the plant side. Its long range attack allows Cactus to provide long range support to the plant team. Cactus also have the ability to plant Potato Mines around the map, which deal 175 damage to any zombie stepping on it, and plant Tallnut Battlement to block zombies, and protect its teams and itself. These abilities allow Cactus to create a safe haven for plants, and prevent zombies from entering it. It can also fly a Garlic Drone to fight zombies from other angles, flanking them, and call a Corn strike dealing maximum damage to group of zombies. However, Cactus are ineffective at close combat range due to its low health, and quite inaccurate without scoping.</p>

<p style= "color: grey">The Engineer is a zombie in Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare. It is one of the four playable zombies on the Zombies faction and serves as the Zombies' equivalent to the Cactus. The Engineer has strong weapons like the Zombot Drone and useful abilities like a Sonic Grenade which stuns plants and forces Chompers to go above the ground or riding on a Jackhammer. It can also build teleporters and Zombot Turrets.</p>

<p style= "color: grey">The Scientist is a playable zombie in Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare. It is the healer class on the zombies faction, but his secondary functionality is for scouting around picking off enemies at closer engagements.</p>

<img src="http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/gardenwarfare.gamepedia.com/thumb/4/48/All-Star_Garden_Warfare.jpg/275px-All-Star_Garden_Warfare.jpg?version=3abe0e8e74c5863089396885f22b83d3" width="100" height="120">
<p style= "color: grey">All-Star is a zombie in Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare. All-Star is a playable character on the zombie's side. All-Star is classified as a powerful tank in the zombie fraction. The All-Star has the highest health than any zombie or plant (200 health). Due to its health, it could tank on multiple hits making them resistance to most plant attacks. It can even survive a direct hit from a Potato Mine (only if its health is over 175). However, it is the slowest character of the zombies, making them ineffective in chasing plants. The All-Star is armed with an Imp Punt ability, which can deal high splash damage to a group of plants. Its Sprint Tackle ability allows it to tackle wounded opponents, vanquishing them or knocking them out of the battle or used to escape threat from plants, especially Chomper. Dummy Shield ability allows the All-Star to create temporary shield to itself and its team from plant attacks.</p>
